### 👋 Hi there, I'm **Rajendra**  

With **5.5+ years** of IT experience, I bring a powerful mix of **DevOps** and **Full Stack Development**.  
🔧 I work hands-on with **Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform**, and build scalable **CI/CD pipelines**.  
☁️ On AWS (3+ yrs), I design cloud architectures using **EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, IAM**, and more — with a focus on **high availability** and **auto-scaling**.  
💻 My foundation in **React.js, Node.js, Laravel, MySQL** helps me bridge the gap between code and cloud — making systems smooth, scalable, and secure.
