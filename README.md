### 👨‍💻 About Me

With **5.5+ years of IT experience**, I bring a strong mix of **DevOps** and **Full Stack Development** skills.  
For the past **1.5 years**, I've worked hands-on with tools like **Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform**, and built scalable **CI/CD pipelines**.

I have **3+ years of AWS experience**, designing and deploying services like **EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, Route 53, IAM**, and more—focusing on **high availability** and **auto-scaling**.

My earlier background in **React.js, Node.js, Laravel, and MySQL** helps me bridge the gap between development and infrastructure for smoother, more reliable deployments.
